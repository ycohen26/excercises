# # Spend the next 5 minutes decomposing the following problem (just decompose the problem,
# #  do not write any code to actually solve the problem for now):
# # #   Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.


#Ten pins
#2 players
#roll a random numeber between 0 - 10
#if 10 then score is 10 plus the next two scores
# if first shot is whatever # and the next = 10 = spare and score includes next number
# if two shots don't add up to 10 then whatever you get is your score
#The 10th Frame
# If you roll a strike in the first shot of the 10th frame, you get 2 more shots.
# If you roll a spare in the first two shots of the 10th frame, you get 1 more shot.
# If you leave the 10th frame open after two shots, the game is over and you do not get an additional shot.
# How to Score: The score for the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down in the 10th frame.

#A strike followed by a spare earns 20 points in a frame.
# A spare followed by a strike earns 20 points in a frame.
# The maximum score in one frame is 30 which is achieved by rolling 3 consecutive strikes.
